While starting out slalom with my friend, we spoke about using his stopwatch,
which means he has to carry a hundred meter of cable everytime.

So as I was toying around with esp8266 for home automation stuff, I thought it
could be possible to do something with it, and instead of going for simply
replacing the cable, I started thinking about making the whole stuff myself.

A lot of ideas started to spring in my mind and I decided to make this website
to list the main design idea, and the various tests I could do.

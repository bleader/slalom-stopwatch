## Slalom Stopwatch

**Status**: Currently doing proof of concept for the different parts.

This project aims to create a wireless stopwatch for slalom.

The goal is to use wifi to get start and stop stations talking to each other,
bluetooth BLE beacons to detect which riders goes through, and ultrasonic
sensors as start-stop triggers.

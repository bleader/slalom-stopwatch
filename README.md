# slalom-stopwatch
A wirless stopwatch for slalom skateboarding

I'll keep the *master* branch empty, as there are multiple parts for this
project, each one will be in its own branch.

* start: start switch code
* stop: stop switch code, which will also be the wifi AP, and have the display
* gh-pages: the site at http://bleader.github.io/slalom-stopwatch/
